# The-Illuminated-Switches
Problem Statement:
You are in a room with 100 light bulbs, initially all turned off. Outside the room, there are 100 switches, labeled from 1 to 100, all in the off position. Each switch corresponds to one light bulb inside the room. You have permission to enter the room only once. Your task is to determine which switches control which light bulbs. The catch is that you can only toggle each switch once. How can you identify the switches that control the light bulbs?

Solution:
Turn on all the switches and leave them on for a few minutes. Then, turn them all off again. Enter the room. The bulb that is turned on corresponds to the switch that was toggled an odd number of times. The bulbs that are turned off correspond to the switches that were toggled an even number of times. By examining the state of the bulbs, you can identify which switches control which light bulbs.
